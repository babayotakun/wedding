# Wedding Invitation Mockup with Recommended Background

## Visual Preview

If you implement the recommended "Mystical Forest Path" background image, your wedding invitation would have the following appearance:

### Overall Look
- The golden forest path background creates a magical, ethereal atmosphere that perfectly complements the Lord of the Rings theme
- The dark overlay ensures all text remains readable while preserving the mystical quality of the image
- The golden light filtering through the trees harmonizes with the gold accents in the design (ring animation, headings, elvish text)

### Section-by-Section Appearance

**Header Section:**
- The glowing golden ring animation stands out against the forest background
- "One Wedding to Rule Them All" title appears prominently with its gold color and text shadow
- The elvish text below adds authenticity and mystery

**Invitation Section:**
- "The Fellowship of Marriage" heading and the names "Aragorn & Arwen" are clearly visible
- Date, location, and time information is easy to read against the semi-transparent black background of the section

**Details Section:**
- The three detail boxes (Ceremony, Feast, Gifts) have good contrast against the background
- The hover effect on these boxes adds an interactive element that works well with the magical theme

**RSVP Section:**
- The gold RSVP button stands out as a call to action
- The hover effect (turning fully gold) creates an engaging interactive element

**Footer:**
- The quote and elvish text provide a fitting conclusion to the invitation

## Mobile Appearance

On mobile devices:
- The background image scales appropriately to fit smaller screens
- All text remains readable due to the responsive design
- The sections stack vertically for easy scrolling
- The ring animation and other elements resize proportionally

## Implementation Result

After implementing the recommended background:
1. The invitation will have a much stronger Lord of the Rings aesthetic
2. The visual appeal will be significantly enhanced compared to the current placeholder background
3. The overall user experience will be more immersive and thematic
4. The invitation will better reflect the magical union of Aragorn and Arwen
