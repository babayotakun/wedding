## Overview

In response to the request to host the Lord of the Rings themed wedding invitation on a free platform, I've created comprehensive documentation that outlines multiple hosting options and provides step-by-step instructions for each. This summary brings together all the work done to address the hosting requirements.

## Files Created/Modified

1. **deployment-guide.md**
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions for hosting on four different free platforms
   - Comparison table of hosting options
   - Recommendations for beginners
   - Next steps after deployment

2. **Updated README.md**

   - Added a new "Hosting Options" section with platform overviews
   - Added background image considerations for hosting
   - Updated the Files section to include all documentation

## Hosting Options Provided

The documentation covers four excellent free hosting platforms:

1. **GitHub Pages**
   - Perfect for developers familiar with Git
   - Simple setup process
   - Integrates well with version control

2. **Netlify**
   - Recommended for beginners due to its simplicity
   - Drag-and-drop deployment option
   - Additional features like form handling and custom domains

3. **Vercel**
   - Fast performance
   - Preview deployments

## Implementation Notes

The wedding invitation website is ready for hosting with no modifications required:

- All resource paths are relative (styles.css, script.js)
- External resources use absolute HTTPS URLs (Google Fonts)
- The background image is currently hosted on Imgur, which works well for hosting

If you choose to use one of the recommended Unsplash background images:
1. Download the image
2. Upload it alongside your other files when deploying
3. Update the CSS to use a relative path

## Recommended Approach for Beginners

For those new to web hosting, **Netlify** offers the best balance of simplicity and features:
1. Create a free Netlify account
2. Use the drag-and-drop upload feature
3. Your site will be live in minutes with a Netlify subdomain
4. Optionally customize the subdomain to something more memorable

## Next Steps

1. Review the deployment-guide.md file for detailed instructions
2. Choose the hosting platform that best suits your needs
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions to deploy your wedding invitation
4. Share the URL with your wedding guests
