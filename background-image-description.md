# Lord of the Rings Wedding Invitation Background Image

## Description
A mystical forest scene inspired by the landscapes of Middle Earth, perfect for Aragorn and Arwen's wedding invitation. The image should feature:

1. **Ancient forest setting** - Tall mallorn trees with silver-gold leaves, reminiscent of Lothl√≥rien where Arwen lived
2. **Soft, magical lighting** - Golden sunset light filtering through the trees, creating a warm, ethereal atmosphere
3. **Subtle elvish elements** - Perhaps distant elvish architecture or lanterns hanging from branches
4. **Misty atmosphere** - Light fog or mist to create depth and mystery
5. **Natural color palette** - Predominantly greens, golds, and soft blues that complement the website's color scheme:
   - Forest green: #1e3a2b
   - Gold: #d4af37
   - Dark gold: #b8860b
   - Parchment: #f5e9d3
   - Dark brown: #3a2a18

## Technical Requirements
- **Resolution**: High resolution (at least 1920x1080px) to ensure quality on all devices
- **Format**: JPG or PNG with good compression (to maintain fast loading times)
- **Composition**: Open space in the center where text will be overlaid, with more detailed elements around the edges
- **Darkness level**: Slightly dark to work with the existing overlay (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)) and ensure text readability

## Implementation Instructions
1. Save the image file as `lotr-wedding-bg.jpg` in the wedding-invitation directory
2. Update the CSS in styles.css (line 23) to:
   ```
   background-image: url('lotr-wedding-bg.jpg');
   ```

## Alternative Options
If creating a custom image is not possible, consider these alternatives:

1. **Rivendell-inspired background**: A serene elven valley with waterfalls and architecture
2. **Shire landscape**: Rolling green hills with hobbit holes in the distance
3. **Abstract magical pattern**: Gold elvish script or ring inscriptions on a dark forest green background
4. **White Tree of Gondor**: A stylized image of the White Tree with a starry background
