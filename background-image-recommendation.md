# Background Image Recommendation

Based on the requirements for a Lord of the Rings themed wedding invitation, here are specific recommendations for background images that would work well with the design:

## Recommended Images

## Implementation Steps

1. **Download the image**:
   - Visit the URL of your preferred image
   - Click the download button to save the full-resolution image
   - Rename the file to `lotr-wedding-bg.jpg`

2. **Optimize the image** (optional but recommended):
   - Use a tool like TinyPNG (https://tinypng.com/) to compress the image without losing quality
   - This will improve page loading speed

3. **Add the image to your project**:
   - Place the `lotr-wedding-bg.jpg` file in the `wedding-invitation` directory

4. **Update the CSS**:
   - Open `styles.css`
   - Find line 23 with the current background image
   - Replace it with: `background-image: url('lotr-wedding-bg.jpg');`

5. **Test the result**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to see how the new background looks
   - Check on different screen sizes to ensure it works well on mobile devices

## Customization Options

If you want to adjust the darkness of the overlay to better match your chosen image:

1. Find line 37 in `styles.css`: `background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);`
2. Adjust the last value (0.7) to control the opacity:
   - Increase for a darker overlay (e.g., 0.8)
   - Decrease for a lighter overlay (e.g., 0.6)

This will help ensure text remains readable regardless of which background image you choose.
